#Abstract 
###In my paper I tried to explore the impact of weather on the stock market. Do colder days have lower returns than warmer days? It is a known fact that weather has an impact on people's mood and behavior(Kang, Jiang, Lee, & Yoon, 2010). My assumption was that colder days make people sad and therefore more bearish or pessimistic in their treading while sunny hot days make people happier and more bullish or optimistic. I was evaluating whether this assumption holds in the New York stock exchange. Many studies tried to answer this question and I used the literature to guide my research. My main goal was to determine if there is correlation between warm days and higher returns. My research included the NYSE index daily returns for a period of several years and compared it to weather data of those same days. I conducted different statistical analysis to determine correlation (see data and analysis section for more detail). 
The main obstacle is the fact that not only New Yorkers are trading the New York Stock exchange, and those people may live in areas with a different weather, which in turns have different impact on their behavior. However, my assumption was that this is a small segment of the traders in the New York stock exchange. My hope was that my research would provide another criterion to evaluate while trading.
